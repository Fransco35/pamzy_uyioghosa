          There are a number of over-the-counter and prescription antifungals
          available to treat ringworm. These antifungals can be sold in a
          variety of forms, such as creams, gels, or powders. By using an oral
          antifungal, your health professional can treat ringworm more
          effectively. <br />
          OTC medications examples; Clotrimazole, Miconazole.

          Your GP may write you a prescription for oral medication if the
          ringworm hasn’t cleared in 2 to 3 weeks. Examples of oral medications;
          Fluconazole, Itraconazole.
          <br />
          Just as the need arose for new diagnostic tools to detect new strains
          of ringworm, there is also a need to find new innovative technological
          ways to treat ringworm effectively.

            <strong>The use of nanotechnology:</strong> Liposomes as a new
            option for the treatment of ringworm; Cell membranes are composed of
            the same kind of fat molecules as liposomes, which are small,
            bubble-like structures. These bubbles can include materials based on
            water and have one or more layers. They can transport medications or
            other things to particular bodily areas, much like tiny water
            balloons. There are many advantages to using these tiny bubbles,
            they can improve the effectiveness of medications and assist in
            treating infections that don’t improve with standard care.

            Making antifungal medications better and more efficient, is a main
            goal of using already exciting antifungal medications and improving
            on them. This is achieved by altering their chemical structure and
            creating new versions that are effective in fighting infections
            while having fewer side effects.
